Denovix RNA Spectrophotometry
The Denovix DS-11 is a device used to quantify RNA. Data graphed by the Denovix machine can be captured by screenshot but this data is not neat and the description of data is not very good for presentation. 
I used knowledge from my Biometrics/Econometrics classes and open code to come up with unique code to rearrange the raw data and plot it using ggplot.
